I am a research-driven graduate student completing two Master's degrees at the **University of Geneva**: one in **Interdisciplinary Neuroscience** and one in **Advanced Research in Psychology**.

My academic journey reflects a commitment to bridging the gap between cognitive psychology and neuroscience. I possess extensive training in:
* **Behavioral Science & Experimental Design**
* **Neuroimaging:** fMRI, EEG, and MEG
* **Data Analysis:** Proficiency in R and Python

Currently, I am working on characterizing word processing pathways using frequency tagging, aiming to apply evidence-based tools to enhance our understanding of language processing.
